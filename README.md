# Computer-Vision-based-Vibration-Measurement
The helicopter tail rotor vibration monitoring system uses computer vision technology. It is capable of adapting to various outdoor lighting conditions and backgrounds, demonstrating excellent generalization. The system can process frames at a rate of 90FPS, and it maintains vibration detection accuracy within 1 mm. The Design won the "Top 21st" of the 17th China Graduate Electronic Design Competition National Finals.(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZK411U73r/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=1f654d68cd5766e82cd5f0e87c11572b)
